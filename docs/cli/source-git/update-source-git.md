# `packit source-git update-source-git`

Sync changes made in a dist-git repository back to the corresponding
source-git repository.

This is to enable engineers and bots to capture and sync back changes done
in dist-git (by provenpackagers during rebuilds, for example). This is why
changes to the source and patches are not supported! If a package has a
source-git repository set up, the expectation is that the bulk of the
packaging work is going to happen there.

## Help

    Usage: packit source-git update-source-git [OPTIONS] DIST_GIT SOURCE_GIT
                                               [REVISION_RANGE]

      Update a source-git repository based on a dist-git repository.

      Update a source-git repository with the selected checkout of a spec file and
      additional packaging files from a dist-git repository.

      Revision range represents part of dist-git history which is supposed to be
      synchronized. Use `HEAD~..` if you want to synchronize the last commit from
      dist-git. For more information on possible revision range formats, see
      gitrevisions(7). If the revision range is not specified, dist-git commits
      with no counterpart in source-git will be synchronized.

      If patches or the sources file in the spec file changed, the command exits
      with return code 2. Such changes are not supported by this command, code
      changes should happen in the source-git repo.

      Inapplicable changes to the .gitignore file are ignored since the file may
      not be synchronized between dist-git and source-git.

      This command, by default, performs only local operations and uses the
      content of the source-git and dist-git repositories as it is, no checkout or
      fetch is performed.

      After the synchronization is done, packit will inform about the changes it
      has performed and about differences between source-git and dist-git prior to
      the synchronization process.

      Dist-git commit messages are preserved and used when creating new source-git
      commits, but a 'From-dist-git-commit' trailer is appended to them to mark
      the hash of the dist-git commit from which they are created.

      Examples

      Take the extra (not synchronized) commit(s) of systemd dist-git repo and
      copy the spec file and other packaging files into the source-git repo:

          $ packit source-git update-source-git rpms/systemd src/systemd

      Synchronize changes from the last three dist-git commits:

          $ packit source-git update-source-git rpms/systemd src/systemd HEAD~3..

    Options:
      -f, --force  Don't check the synchronization status of the source-git and
                   dist-git repos prior to performing the update.
      -h, --help   Show this message and exit.
