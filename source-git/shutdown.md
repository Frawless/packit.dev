# Service integration for CentOS Stream shut down

The Packit team wants to let all its users know that the cluster, where the [*source-git service*](/source-git/status.md#service-integration-for-centos-stream) was running, has sadly been shut down.

We can migrate the service to a new cluster but we want to be sure this big effort, for our small team, has some value.

If you are using the *Service integration for CentOS Stream* please **reach out to the Packit team** on Matrix (#packit:fedora.im), on Slack (#team-packit)
or email (mailto:hello@packit.dev); we can discuss the future steps together.

If we collect no feedback then the *Service integration for CentOS Stream* will definitely be shut down.

You can read more about the reasons why we are no longer supporting *source-git* at [Packitâ€™s statement on Source-git for 2023](/source-git/status.md).
