## Week 20 (May 14th â€“ May 20th)

- When running `dist-git init` command from CLI, you can pass a command to specify the git URL of the project. ([packit#2308](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2308))
- We have fixed the incorrect displaying of the time it took for the jobs to run on dashboard. ([dashboard#408](https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/408))
