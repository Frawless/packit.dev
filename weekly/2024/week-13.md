## Week 13 (March 27th â€“ April 2nd)

- The default behaviour of changelog entry generation has been changed to comply with Fedora Packaging Guidelines
  (see the relevant Fedora Packaging Committee [discussion](https://pagure.io/packaging-committee/issue/1339)).
  From now on, the default changelog entry is "- Update to version \<version\>".
  Users can still affect this behaviour using custom commands in the `changelog-entry` action
  or with the `copy_upstream_release_description` configuration option.
  ([packit#2253](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2253))

- "[packit]" prefix has been removed from default dist-git commit message titles in order to prevent
  unnecessary noise in autogenerated changelog. Users can override this using the `commit-message` action.
  ([packit#2263](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2263))
