## Week 11 (March 12th â€“ March 18th)

- Don't have time to set up Packit? Or, do you want to see what it would look like on your package?
  Starting now, you can [ask the Packit team](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/new?assignees=&labels=onboarding&projects=&template=onboarding.yml&title=Onboard+%5Bmy+package%5D) to prepare a config file for you. ([packit-service#2369](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2369))
- A trailing newline is no longer added to spec files without one upon saving. ([specfile#353](https://github.com/packit/specfile/pull/353))
