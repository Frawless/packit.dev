## Week 39 (September 24th â€“ September 30th)

- Check for `upstream_project_url` presence in the configuration when `pull_from_upstream` job is configured was removed from `validate-config`, as this is no longer required. ([packit#2423](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2423))
- We have added a note about retriggering `pull_from_upstream` job from dist-git pull requests. ([packit-service#2542](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2542))
