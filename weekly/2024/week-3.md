- We have increased the number of retries of Fedora release syncing for situations where the tarball is uploaded some time after the release happens. ([packit-service#2307](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2307))
- There is a new API endpoint `/bodhi-updates` for getting information about Bodhi updates submitted by Packit. ([packit-service#2310](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2310))
- For `/packit test` command, you can now also use `-i` and `--id` aliases for `--identifier` option. ([packit-service#2309](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2309))
