## Week 1 (January 2nd â€“ January 8th)

- We have changed the behaviour of loading Packit configuration for `koji_build` and `bodhi_update` jobs.
  For both of them, the behaviour is the same as for `pull_from_upstream` - the configuration is taken
  from the default branch of the dist-git repository (usually `rawhide`) and other branches are ignored.
