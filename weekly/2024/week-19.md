## Week 19 (May 7th â€“ May 13th)

- Added a `scan-in-osh` subcommand in the CLI to perform a scan through OpenScanHub. By default it performs a full scan of the packages and a differential scan can be performed through `--base-srpm` option. ([packit#2301](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2301))
